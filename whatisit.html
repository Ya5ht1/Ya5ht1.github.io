                    <p>Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. 
                    It encompasses a wide range of technologies, processes, and practices designed to safeguard sensitive information 
                    from unauthorized access, theft, and damage. As cyber threats continue to evolve, effective cybersecurity 
                    measures are essential for maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data.</p>
